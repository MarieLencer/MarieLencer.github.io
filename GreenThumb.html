								<h2>Project Description</h2>
								<p>
									Green Thumb is an urban gardening idle game. The game was developed as a 2D game in Godot. 
                  The objective of the game is to grow plants keeping in my the correct conditions for each type of plant like sun exposure, watering frequency and fertilizer status.
                  Each plant starts as a seedling and have to be cultivated from there. With good care plants can grow to adult form. When they reach their final phase offshoots can be obtained from the plant and used as new seedlings.
                  During their lifecycle the health status of a plant is very important. They can either be healthy, sick or dead. Once dead a plant has to be thrown out. 
                  Only healthy plants can reach the next phase of growth. 
                  As time passes plants need to be watered, but too much or too little water will make them sick. Fertilizer helps speed up the growth but should not be used to often. 
                  Each plant species has different requirements on where they should be placed in the room and how much water and fertilizer they need.

									This project was created as part of my game design master's degree at the Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin.

								<h2>My Responsibilites</h2>
								<p>
									This game was developed by myself using the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/2d-casual-isometric-pack-197633">Casual Isometric Pack by Persefida</a> and plant assets designed by Bianca Dreißig.
